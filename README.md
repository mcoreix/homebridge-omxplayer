## Why do we need this plugin?

This plugin is great for getting some music and videos into scenes and automations, for example:
- It can be used for a "Good Night" scene with a lullaby music for babies (can be done with speakers only connected to Pi).
- It can play music videos on TV screen (connected to the Raspberry Pi) when "Arrive Home" is triggered.
- it can be connected to a projector and project any video (I used it for the kids room).

## How it works

Basically, all you need to do is:
1. Set the desired youtube url or local filename.
2. Use this switch in any scene or automation.

when setting a new youtube link, only for the first time,the video will be downloaded which should take a few seconds.

## How to install
 ```sudo apt-get install omxplayer```

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-omxplayer```

The raspberry pi should be logged in with the same user that runs homebridge.
It is suggested to use auto-login when Raspberry rebooted.

## Troubleshooting

### Permissions issue
If you're running `homebridge` on a different user than `pi` you may have permission issues. Try running the following commands:

`sudo usermod -a -G video $(whoami)`

`sudo chmod 777 /usr/lib/node_modules/homebridge-omxplayer/node_modules/youtube-dl/bin/youtube-dl`

Delete any `.mp4` files inside your `/tmp` folder.

Make sure your `home` folder exists at `/home/USERNAME` and run `sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/USERNAME`

Reboot and try again.
